# Overview
Really enjoyed working on JavaScript for the first time. Code can definitely be optimised, but the purpose of this project was to understand JavaScript & the DOM.

## Description
After learning JavaScript for a few days, I decided to try out a very basic first project. Within a couple of hours, I managed to complete the task. From there, I moved onto my next project with condfidence and a stronger understanding of both programming and JavaScript.

## What I learned about JavaScript
I learned some essential skills within this small project.
* Importing HTML Elements with the DOM
* Learning the difference between const / let
* How event listeners are used
* Manipulation of HTML elements
* How to use JavaScript documentation for a better understanding of the language and certain components.

### Things to be improved
Optimisation of code is something that can definitely be worked upon in the coming months. However, my goal is to keep expanding into multiple small projects to grasp a deep understanding of programming and JavaScript specifically.
